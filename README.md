Hello and welcome to Bakken & Bæck. You're probably here because you're looking to just get started, or need to remember something on how we agreed on doing things, or you're just going around looking for ways on how to streamline your team process.

The goal of this document is to display the different agreements that we've made in the Bakken & Bæck iOS team. Every time a new member joins we make sure to revisit it in it's entirety, to make sure that we are all still aligment with this principles.

One of the first things that you'll encounter as you start collaborating with us is that the take pride of sharing knowledge by using pull requests. For this is important that all our commits share a similar structure and follow best practices to give your teammates the required tools to collaborate with you. The main document to get started on that, is our [Git and GitHub guidelines](/GIT_AND_GITHUB.md).
