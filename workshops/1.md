# B&B 1st iOS Workshop

First we started out by brainstorming possible discussion subjects:

</p>

Then we condesed this into notes we could vote on, this would help us to prioritize the most important topics first. We'll have intervals of 20 minutes, at the end of this interval we would vote to continue for 20 minutes more or to close the topic.

- Discuss common problems in the work design
- Discuss about clients
- Talk about the future of the iOS team
- Discuss common problmes in the development process
- Discuss guidelines on contributing to open source
- Talk about our Unsplash client
- Discuss how things have been done so far
- Discuss common challenges
- Review playbook
- Revisit our iOS test for new hires

## Team

### Better tool than Jira
- Sprint planning
- Backlog
- Estimates
- Track work, Harvest integration
- Retrospective tools, comparison between what you planned and what you did
- Link pull requests to Jira tasks

### Travis
Travis will be used for open source, we'll remove it from our private projects because is too slow and breaks all the time. For private projects we'll use an screenshot of Xcode with the tests passing instead, as a confirmation that the tests are working.

### Slack
We'll have 3 channels:
- #ios: General conversation
- #ios-pull-requests: Notifications about pull requests
- #ios-resources: Links for interesting articles and snippets

### GitHub

#### Pull requests
We'll have a pull request buddie. This person will be your backup guy, either when you need to take some time off, or when you need to get your pull request reviewed. Ideally it should have as much information about the details of the project as you do, so make sure to catch up every now and then.

When reviewing a pull request and there's something missing or incorrect, first suggest the change, don't just make it. This basically to ensure that you both aren't fixing the same problem. We should add this to the Git guidelines.

We agreed that the project owner will be the one merging the pull requests.

Finally, we agreed that we need to make better pull request descriptions, adding screenshots, gifs, movies and steps to reproduce when needed.

#### Issues

We agreed on disabling GitHub issues for internal projects and moving all issue communication to Jira or similar tools.

### README

We'll include the project owner and project buddie to the README.

We agreed that the README will be used to have a small description of what the project is about in non-techie language.

### GIFs

Would be cool to have a better tool to make gifs or videos of our apps. We could provide a way to choose the type of device or simulator to use.

### Daily standups

We agreed that daily standups suck, specially since they are not asynchronous.

### Workshop

We said that the workshop was awesome, and we should try to have something similar once a month. Can't remember the date.

### Articles

We'll do articles, we talked about doing it in the simplest blogging platform we could find, the threshold to publish a new post should be super low, and basically help us to share fast and often.

We'll make a new blog post about fun things that we learned, gotchas that we found while solving a problem, and posts introducing any open source component that we do.

### Gists

We'll use gists more (?).

### Clients

When a new project gets assigned to get started we'll do a group brainstorming to look for flaws in the design and to discuss the project structure and make sure we're all in the same page.

We agreed that making clear with iOS versions will be suported from the beginning will help a lot to avoid misunderstandings. And use iPhone when talking about an iPhone app instead of iOS, this sounds a bit obvious but we tend to use iOS which in really means both iPhone and iPad.

We are going to try to not be scheduled on more than one project at the time, and if it happens it shouldn't be in the same day. Also we'll propose to change the effective working hours of an estimated day from 8 to 7, since nobody really works 8 hours on a normal workday.

We agreed to add a testing phase to our estimates, this will account as 10% of the total amount of work. We'll make sure after each milestone that this testing phase is respected and no new features are introduced. Basically we want to ensure the quality of our deliveries and pay some of the technical debt.

We agreed that if it can't be reproduced then is not a bug.

We agreed that being aware of when the customer is going to demo the projects is critical for better planning on our side. When it will be made, which devices will be used, etc.

We agreed to only work with our own backends, and if we're forced to use an external backend use a middle layer that eases some of the pain with dealing with external APIs.

Finally we need to *always* unit test the API calls, so far we haven't had a good experience working with APIs so this might change in the future if things change, for as for now, Gotta Test 'Em all.
