# B&B 1st iOS Workshop

First we started out by brainstorming possible discussion subjects:

</p>

Then we condesed this into notes we could vote on, this would help us to prioritize the most important topics first. We'll have intervals of 20 minutes, at the end of this interval we would vote to continue for 20 minutes more or to close the topic.

- Discuss common problems in the work design
- Discuss about clients
- Talk about the future of the iOS team
- Discuss common problmes in the development process
- Discuss guidelines on contributing to open source
- Talk about our Unsplash client
- Discuss how things have been done so far
- Discuss common challenges
- Review playbook
- Revisit our iOS test for new hires

## Team

### Better tool than Jira
- Sprint planning
- Backlog
- Estimates
- Track work, Harvest integration
- Retrospective tools, comparison between what you planned and what you did
- Link pull requests to Jira tasks

### Travis
Travis will be used for open source, we'll remove it from our private projects because is too slow and breaks all the time. For private projects we'll use an screenshot of Xcode with the tests passing instead, as a confirmation that the tests are working.

### Slack
We'll have 3 channels:
- #ios: General conversation
- #ios-pull-requests: Notifications about pull requests
- #ios-resources: Links for interesting articles and snippets
